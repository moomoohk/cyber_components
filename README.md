# cyber_components

`cyber_components` is a library meant to help you represent your cyber environments with Python objects and a database.

`cyber_components` is currently optimized for Windows environments but there are plans to include other environments.

Examples of components that may be represented with `cyber_components`:
* Machines (PCs, servers, anything in between)
* Network interfaces
* Windows sessions
* Processes
* File system objects (drives, folders, files)
* Much more

All components are declared in Pythonic classes and reference each other. 

For example, since processes run on machines `Machine` objects will have a list of `Process` objects linked.

All components are automatically stored and linked to each other in a SQLite database for further manipulation and inspection.

Components can be created manually or generated by scripts that receive live network data.

## Working with components

Suppose you'd like to represent a machine that has:
* A `web_server.exe` process with PID 1234
* Port 80 bound by `web_server.exe` listening for TCP connections on `127.0.0.1`

```python
from cyber_components.db import Machine, NetworkInterface, Port, PortState, Protocol, Session, Process

machine = Machine(
    hostname="test",
)
loopback = NetworkInterface(
    ipv4="127.0.0.1", 
    name="Loopback Ethernet Adapter",
)
port = Port(
    protocol=Protocol.TCP, 
    number=80, 
    state=PortState.LISTENING, 
    pid=1234,
)
session = Session(
    name="Console",
    number=1,
)
process = Process(
    pid=1234, 
    name="web_server.exe",
)

# Port and process objects will be automatically linked via pid

session.processes.append(process)

machine.network_info.interfaces.append(loopback)
machine.sessions.append(session)

```
